# WebGL Utils
A collection of lightweight utility libraries to smooth over some of the more
tedious parts of building a WebGL app. These are designed to be used
individually with little to no interdependence and no dependencies on external
libraries.

This is not a Framework or Engine, just some functions that make WebGL a little
easier. I'll probably add to it over time, but don't expect too much in the way
of ongoing support.
